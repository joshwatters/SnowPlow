## Autonomous Snow Plow - Overall Risk Assessment Summary
E-Stop - (physical and remote) mechanisms stop all power and motion on command, Remote E-Stop is always able to cut power to the robot, Snowplow moves at a safe speed - Vehicle stops within 3 meters of either E-Stop being triggered
Guidance - Snowplow autonomously follows our planned course Remote E-Stop range ≥ 50 m,  Snowplow speed ≤ 2 m/s, Within 5 inches of our path
Operation - Robot can operate in the required conditions - The robot can operate in temperatures between 0 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit and in wet/snowy conditions.
Batteries - Temperature and lack of charge are problematic because the entire system relies on the batteries - Insulating battery box, Charge rotation and frequent checking
Electronic Components - Failing or malfunctioning components can cause varying degrees of system failure such as electrical shorts, incorrect sensor output, etc. - Surge protectors, Fuses, Power relays, E-Stops
Navigation System/Software - Errors in the navigation system can cause the snowplow to move in unanticipated directions - E-Stops, Algorithm testing


## Plowing Strategy:
“T” Snowfield

## Sensors
* GPS RTK
* Precise translational positioning
* Adafruit BNO055 9-Axis IMU
* Gyroscope and magnetometer track rotation
* SICK 2D LiDAR 
  * Detects cones at the start of the run
  * Dijkstra's Algorithm
  * Start with a set of nodes we want to visit
  * Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find paths from one node to the next, avoiding cones
  * Squares with snow in them have lower weights than other squares


## Size & Weight Dimensions:
* 4 ft  wide
* ~3.5 ft long, 4.5 ft with blade
* 2.3 ft tall at highest point
* Blade is 4.5 feet wide
* ~700lbs

## Materials:
* 1in thick Steel base plate
* Aluminum extrusion framing
* OSB wood and foam insulation battery box
* Plastic electronics enclosure 

## Drive System:
* 2x AmpFlow™ gear motors
* 2.1 hp peak, 24 VDC
* Skid steer
* Chain driven
* ~1 m/s max speed

## Power:
* 4x 12V Deep Cycle Marine/RV Batteries
* Lead Acid chemistry
* 2x wired in series which are then wired in parallel
* 24V output

## Electronics Housing
* Plastic enclosure
* Thermally Insulative
* +24VDC supplied by car batteries
* Components mounted with screws/3M™ Dual Lock™
* Electrical connections made with Anderson Power poles, lug terminals, and screw terminals.
* Cable glands used for wiring to inside of box
* 3D printed brackets for mounting some components

## Jetson Nano Orin
* Runs JetpackOS and ROS 2
* Remotely controllable via SSH
* Arduino MEGA
* Interacts with Jetson via serial communication
* Sends signals to motor controllers and plow lift solenoid valves
* Also sends IMU data to the Jetson

## Physical & Remote E-Stop
* Power cut if either triggered
* Remote E-Stop is a dead man's switch

## Stopping Distance -
* 2" on cement
* 4 rough tread tires
* Slow moving (~1m/s)

## Testing:
* GPS RTK - Acquire positioning coordinates from the GPS RTK system while the snowplow moves and check their accuracy - GPS RTK Data - Position Coordinates
* ROS Serial Motor Control - Control Motor Speed Through Arduino over ROS Serial Outputs from Jetson Nano - Motor Speed Values - Motor Movement
* LiDAR Cone Detection - Acquire positioning of all the cones on the field that the LiDAR detects, and disregard all other LiDAR data - LiDAR Data - Cone Positioning

## Failure Modes & Recovery Actions
* Motor Chains - The motor chains disengage during use - Activate remote or physical E-Stop, Restore chain manually and safely
* Batteries and Electronics - The batteries or electronics freeze up or exhibit reduced functionality because of cold temperatures - Engage heating system
* Processors, Sensors, & Software - The robot takes an incorrect route during a run due to processing or sensing error - Activate remote or physical E-Stop, Return robot to start point, Make any adjustments, Restart guidance software
