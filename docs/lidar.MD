Before the lidar will function, IP configuration must be complete or the Lidar will not be able to recieve packets. The current implementation 
involves using the sick_scan_xd packages that "publish" data over a ROS2 topic. (This is different from the script that is being used to generate the above images; 
It is in here to show how to parse a packet if the team decides to stray from ROS2.) This data is retrieved from the topic and used to map the snowplow to a grid. 
More or less we scan, then generate a map on an x,y and ultimately use Dijkstra's for path planning.

The physical connection is insert the ethernet into the Jetson and supply 24v via the quick connector. The Jetson's onboard Wifi must be disabled for the current configuration to work.

To ensure proper configuration, double check the following items and run the command:


```
nc -z -v -w5 192.168.1.2 2112
```


If the IP address is improperly configured, it will fail with the message Network is unreachable. No progress can be made until the connection can be established.

## Installation is: 

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-sick-scan-xd
```

Quick Start Guide:
##### 1. IP Configuration Must Be Completed First:
Set IP for Lidar through Sopas on Windows to 192.168.1.2

##### 2. Set IP for Jetson nano and disable WiFi. On Jetson, terminal command: 

```
ifconfig 
# Produces the following output:
enP8p1s0:Realtek Semiconductor Co.\, Ltd. RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller
wlP1p1s0:Realtek Semiconductor Co.\, Ltd. RTL8822CE 802.11ac PCIe Wireless Network Adapter
# Look through devices for ID of Ethernet
enP8p1s0
ifconfig enP8p1s0
nmcli con add con-name "static-enP8p1s0" ifname enP8p1s0 type ethernet ip4 192.168.1.1/16 gw4 192.168.1.1
nmcli con up "static-enP8p1s0"
```

## Before running Any command in ROS2 you must source the environment. If the environment is not sourced. You can source it on humble by running:

```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

## The file locations may be different on the snowplow. this command can be updated but feel free to use as a template.

```
# Change Directory to launch folder
cd /opt/ros/humble/share/sick_scan_xd/launch

ros2 run sick_scan_xd sick_generic_caller sick_lms_5xx.launch
hostname:=192.168.1.2
```

Runs RVIZ:

```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 run rviz2 rviz2
```

For LMS5xx-family:

Linux native: sick_generic_caller sick_lms_5xx.launch

Linux ROS 2: ros2 run sick_scan_xd sick_generic_caller ./src/sick_scan_xd/launch/sick_lms_5xx.launch
